# 👋 Hi, I'm Filip – Aspiring Cybersecurity Specialist

I'm building my cybersecurity skills from the ground up, with a hands-on, no-excuses, guerrilla-style approach — often working straight from my phone, one commit at a time.

## 🚀 About Me

I'm diving deep into cybersecurity with a broad base in Linux, networking, and scripting. I believe real skills come from real practice — not just watching, but doing.

My background is unconventional, but my determination is non-negotiable. I’m using every spare moment to level up, turning frustration with stagnation into focused growth.

## 🛠 What I Do

- Document my learning journey with notes, labs, and breakdowns
- Analyze topics from multiple angles for deep understanding
- Build and test offensive and defensive tools & techniques
- Learn in the wild — on the road, offline, even from a smartphone

## 💡 Areas of Focus

- **Linux** (Ubuntu, Kali)
- **Scripting & Automation** (Bash)
- **Networking & Security Fundamentals**
- **Penetration Testing & Blue Team Concepts**
